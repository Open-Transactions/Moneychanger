/*
 *
 * * MTBitcoin provides a clean interface for all important bitcoin functions
 *   it is mostly a wrapper for BtcHelper
 *
 * * BtcHelper automates abstract tasks like verifying multisig transactions
 *   by calling BtcJson functions and processing the results
 *
 * * BtcJson provides Bitcoin API functions
 *   it creates Json strings, sends them to bitcoin's http interface via BtcRpcCurl and parses the results
 *   it returns strings, int64 or smart pointers to structures if Json objects are returned
 *
 * * BtcRpcCurl uses libcurl to connect to bitcoin's http interface
 *   it only has a few functions so should be easy to replace with a class using zmq
 *
 * * BtcModules is a class holding pointers to the instances of the other classes
 *   it isn't really good for anything but makes things a bit easier imho
 *
 * * btcobjects.h is a collection of various structs
 *   most of them imitate the objects returned in bitcoind's replies
