/*
 *
 * * MTBitcoin provides a clean interface for all important bitcoin functions
 *   it is mostly a wrapper for BtcHelper
 *
 * * BtcHelper automates abstract tasks like verifying multisig transactions
 *   by calling BtcJson functions and processing the results
 *
 * * BtcJson provides Bitcoin API functions
 *   it creates Json strings, sends them to bitcoin's http interface via BtcRpcCurl and parses the results
 *   it returns strings, int64 or smart pointers to structures if Json objects are returned
 *
 * * BtcRpcCurl uses libcurl to connect to bitcoin's http interface
 *   it only has a few functions so should be easy to replace with a class using zmq
 *
 * * BtcModules is a class holding pointers to the instances of the other classes
 *   it isn't really good for anything but makes things a bit easier imho
 *
 * * btcobjects.h is a collection of various structs
 *   most of them imitate the objects returned in bitcoind's replies

        not implemented yet, but bitcoin now offers a nice API function to get that, so if we really need it I can add it almost instantly
        but it does not work for multi-sig

        int64_t GetMultisigBalance(  ) = 0;
        not yet implemented, would be nice if it isn't needed.
        instead we could/should keep track of transaction Ids and their value to know the balance of multi-sig addresses
        and clients should tell the server what the tx id is
        but if needed i can create a function to crawl through the blockchain. will be very CPU intensive but we could tweak it to only go back X days or something like that.
