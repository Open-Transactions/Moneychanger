Have the QT bin folder on your path.

Open a command prompt.

navigate to the ‘project’ folder

run:  qmake

(NB :On systems where OT was compiled with C++11 use

qmake "QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++11"

)

then: make (-jx, where x is the number of threads you want).

navigate to the ‘lib’ directory.
where you will find moneychanger-qt
