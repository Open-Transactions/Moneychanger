The install process on MacOSX is somewhat involved.

(we assume that you already have brew installed, from OT)

#########
# update:
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade

#########
# install libidn

$ brew install libidn


#########
# install QT
$ brew install libpng qt5
$ brew unlink qt
$ brew link —-force qt5

OR. (we can just use the qt4 version)

# brew install qt


#########
# adding path /usr/local/bin to /etc/launchd.conf
# this step adds the path “/usr/local/bin” to all applications that are run from the launcher.

# we will use nano (but you can use your favourite command line text editor.

$ sudo nano /etc/launchd.conf

add/append: setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

make sure you have a blank line at the end of the file.

#########
# download and install QT Creator:
http://qt-project.org/downloads

## add /usr/local to finder favourites.
# open the terminal and run:
$open /usr/local

Now favorite the folder that loads up (you cannot normally get to this folder through finder).

# reboot the pc: (requires a reboot for these changes to take effect).
$ sudo reboot


#########
# Run QT Creator.  You will need to manually setup QT:
qmake location: /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.2.0/bin/qmake

# and the kits (all defaults should be fine)


#########
# Download Moneychanger

$ mkdir -p ~/Scratch/Sources; cd ~/Scratch/Sources
$ git clone git://github.com/Open-Transactions/Moneychanger.git
$ cd Moneychanger


#########
# Compile via cli

# qmake -r project
# cd moneychanger-qt
# make -j2


#########
# Open in QT Creator  (not recommended)

file: ~/Scratch/Sources/Moneychanger/project/moneychanger.pro


Make sure you have Open Transactions installed!

Compile and Run.


Have fun.

This guide, I'm sure, will need more work.
